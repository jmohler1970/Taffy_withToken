# Taffy for REST: Part 10 VueJS + Bootstrap

After working with Buefy and Bulma and some of what they have to offer, I decided to make a bit of a U-turn. I was drawn to Bulma because of its CSS only approach, but Javascript got added right back in via VuaJS and Buefy. I looked as some of the big picture items, and this is what I saw


- Bootstrap is **the** responsive design library. It is everywhere
- Bootswatch provides lots of free themes. Not every Bootstrap website has too look the same going out the door
- The Bootstrap Vue library is much more complete than Buefy
- The code is noticably smaller
- Buefy does not have a killer feature. It does not have anything that I have been able to find that screams "Do this, do this"
- Lastly, I have worked with Bootstrap continuously since version 2. I want to keep building on that skillset.

So Bootstrap Vue it shall be
